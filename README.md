# Project: FF-issues

The aim of this project (aligned with [Open-FF](https://github.com/gwallison/openFF)) is to provide a common place for users of the FracFocus data to document flaws and problems that may interfere with using the data.

The work of detecting and flagging the issues will be handled in the openFF code.  This repository contains the master issue list that is a hand curated text file with problem descriptions, flag IDs, and notes on how they are handled and where within openFF they are detected.
