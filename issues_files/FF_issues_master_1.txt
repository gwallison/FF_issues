# FF_issues_master_1
# Started: Feb 8, 2024
# The two kinds of issues docunented here are disclosure-based ("d_x" flag_id) and record-based ("r_x" flag_id).  
# The code to detect them is in either the Disclosure_Issues or the Record_Issues classes, which are run by the 
# Flag_issues class.  Some of these issues are detected earlier by other build code; the FF_issues flag is generated
# by examining already created flags (e.g. dup_rec or has_TBWV)
#
# Each issue should be assigned a warning_level that is used classify how much attention
# users should give to the issue:
#   info: issues found but are taken care of by Open-FF
#  watch: issues that may be important to users under some circumstances
#  alert: issues that require user judgement, such as outliers, likely data mistakes, or other data flaws that could influence conclusions.

#  Tags:
#    These are used to help group like issues together. An issue can have more than one (separate with space only)
#    Current set:
#      - chem_id
#      - carrier_issues
#      - duplication
#      - mass_issues
#      - 
# to add:
#  - disclosures with a single record, often sand or water or chl dioxide.  Clearly not complete
#  - disclosures where sand is 90%+ - water is not included

# No base water volume
::START:
::Title:No base water volume
::Flag_id: d_001
::Date_entered: 2024/2/8
::Description: Missing or zero TotalBaseWaterVolume in disclosure.  Masses cannot be calculated.

# Duplicate disclosures
::START:
::Title:Duplicate disclosures
::Flag_id: d_002
::Date_entered: 2024/2/8
::Description: This flag indicates that this disclosure has a duplicate in FracFocus; that is, has the same APINumber and JobEndDate. Currently, there is no way to detect which is the correct disclosure, so all duplicates are removed in the standard filter.

# dup_rec
::START:
::Title:Unintentional duplicated records
::Flag_id:r_001	
::Date_entered: 2024/2/8
::Description: This flag indicates that a record is a redundant duplicate of another in the same disclosure. These should be removed with the in_std_filtered flag.
::Notes: As of Jan 2024, these detected duplicates add a median mass of over 60,000 lbs to about 17,000 disclosures.  Between Dec 2023 and Feb 2024, Open-FF could not reliably detect duplicate records without resorting to referencing archived data; beware of data sets downloaded during that period. As of March 2024, FracFocus seems to have made the data onsistent again.   As to the cause of these duplicates, responses from FracFocus about this issue pointed the finger at the companies (about 500 of them) as responsible for this problem.  
::Reported_to_FF:Once in 2019 (blogged about it) and once in Dec 2023.

# MI_inconsistency
::START:
::Title:Inconsistency in MassIngredient
::Flag_id:d_003
::Date_entered: 2024/2/8
::Description: The MassIngredient data do not pass the internal consistency test, so are NOT used when reporting mass.
::Notes:It seems that many times when MassIncredient is internally inconsistent, it is either because one record in the disclosure has been changed (and the others are not adjusted) or small values are reported coarsely and therefore easily out of tolerance.

# WaterSource sum
::START:
::Flag_id: d_004
::Title: WaterSource does not sum to 100%
::Date_entered: 2024/2/8
::Description: The water source percentages reported don't total 100%
::Notes: This new (as of Dec 2023) data appears to be misunderstood or at least inconsistently uesd by some operators.  Some are just re-reporting the PercentHFJob datum for the carrier in the water_source data - and some are even not reporting the water in the main section at all. FracFocus points out that this is an optional field. They do not enforce any consistency in it.
::Reported_to_FF: March 2024.

# Missing or zero PercentHFJob
::START:
::Title:Missing or zero PercentHFJob
::Flag_id: r_002
::Date_entered: 2024/2/8
::Description: PercentHFJob is 0 or not reported; mass cannot be calculated. 
::Notes:This is essentially a hidden mass. Clearly, if a chemical is reported, in reality it has mass a non-zero mass.  Although it seems common in early years of FracFocus that records with very small mass values recorded zero instead of the small number, there are plenty of other disclosures that use zero or no value even if the quantity is large.  The nature of the disclosures prevents us from knowing which is the case.   Note: Some of these may be considered a proprietary designation; hiding the quantity with or without hiding the CASNumber.
