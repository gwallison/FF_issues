# FF_issues_master_1
# Started: Feb 8, 2024
# The two kinds of issues docunented here are disclosure-based ("d_x" flag_id) and record-based ("r_x" flag_id).  
# The code to detect them is in either the Disclosure_Issues or the Record_Issues classes, which are run by the 
# Flag_issues class.  Some of these issues are detected earlier by other build code; the FF_issues flag is generated
# by examining already created flags (e.g. dup_rec or has_TBWV)
#
# Each issue should be assigned a warning_level that is used classify how much attention
# users should give to the issue:
#   info: issues found but are taken care of by Open-FF
#  watch: issues that may be important to users under some circumstances
#  alert: issues that require user judgement, such as outliers, likely data mistakes, or other data flaws that could influence conclusions.

#  Tags:
#    These are used to help group like issues together. An issue can have more than one (separate with space only)
#    Current set:
#      - chem_id
#      - carrier_issues
#      - duplication
#      - mass_issues
#      - 
# to add:
#  - %proprietary > say, 75% (alert)
#  - ING_only bgCAS.  (watch)
#  - location errors (watch)

# Duplicate disclosures
::START:
::Title:Duplicate disclosures
::Flag_id: d_002
::Date_entered: 2024/2/8
::Description: This flag indicates that this disclosure has a duplicate in FracFocus; that is, has the same APINumber and JobEndDate. Currently, there is no way to detect which is the correct disclosure, so all duplicates are removed in the standard filter.

# dup_rec
::START:
::Title:Unintentional duplicated records
::Flag_id:r_001	
::Date_entered: 2024/2/8
::Description: This flag indicates that a record is a redundant duplicate of another in the same disclosure. These should be removed with the in_std_filtered flag.
::Notes: As of Jan 2024, these detected duplicates add a median mass of over 60,000 lbs to about 17,000 disclosures.  Between Dec 2023 and Feb 2024, Open-FF could not reliably detect duplicate records without resorting to referencing archived data; beware of data sets downloaded during that period. As of March 2024, FracFocus seems to have made the data onsistent again.   As to the cause of these duplicates, responses from FracFocus about this issue pointed the finger at the companies (about 500 of them) as responsible for this problem.  
::Reported_to_FF:Once in 2019 (blogged about it) and once in Dec 2023.

# MI_inconsistency
::START:
::Title:Inconsistency in MassIngredient
::Flag_id: d_003
::Date_entered: 2024/2/8
::Description: The MassIngredient data do not pass the internal consistency test, so are NOT used when reporting mass.
::Notes:It seems that many times when MassIncredient is internally inconsistent, it is either because one record in the disclosure has been changed (and the others are not adjusted) or small values are reported coarsely and therefore easily out of tolerance.

# WaterSource sum
::START:
::Flag_id: d_004
::Title: WaterSource does not sum to 100%
::Date_entered: 2024/2/8
::Description: The water source percentages reported don't total 100%
::Notes: This new (as of Dec 2023) data appears to be misunderstood or at least inconsistently uesd by some operators.  Some are just re-reporting the PercentHFJob datum for the carrier in the water_source data - and some are even not reporting the water in the main section at all. FracFocus points out that this is an optional field. They do not enforce any consistency in it.

# Missing or zero PercentHFJob
::START:
::Title:Missing or zero PercentHFJob
::Flag_id: r_002
::Date_entered: 2024/2/8
::Description: PercentHFJob is 0 or not reported; mass cannot be calculated. 
::Notes:This is essentially a hidden mass. Clearly, if a chemical is reported, in reality it has mass a non-zero mass.  Although it seems common in early years of FracFocus that records with very small mass values recorded zero instead of the small number, there are plenty of other disclosures that use zero or no value even if the quantity is large.  The nature of the disclosures prevents us from knowing which is the case.   Note: Some of these may be considered a proprietary designation; hiding the quantity with or without hiding the CASNumber.

# No chemcical records
::START:
::Title:No chemical records in disclosure
::Flag_id:d_005
::Date_entered: 2024/3/11
::Description: A laree number of disclosures in the bulk data download do not have chemical records. These are 
primarily from 2011-2013 and from FFVersion 1.  The chemical records are available in the PDF form in the search
section of FracFocus.  This is detected in the Open-FF data set building process.
::Notes:There have been a few attempts to scrape these PDFs to get coherent access to the chemical
records, including the SkyTruth work during that 2011-2013 period.  Those attempts are somewhat undermined by at least
two factors: 1) PDFs (and other data) can be silently changed by Operators so that the data scraped may be out-of-date 
without regular re-scraping. 2) Many of these early PDFs are quite resistant to automated scraping because they are
often poorly formatted and inconsistent.  These are serious constraints considering there are tens of thousands of 
these disclosures.  Nevertheless, Open-FF has access to some of the scraped versions.  If you are interested in them,
please contact us.

# CASNumber must be corrected
::START:
::Title: CASNumber must be corrected
::Flag_id:r_003
::Date_entered: 2024/3/11
::Description: Many CASNumbers in the FracFocus data have typos, omissions or other errors that are corrected
by hand by Open-FF curation.  Users unfamiliar with the whole set of FracFocus chemicals would likely misinterpret
discard these chemical records without the aid of the Open-FF corrections.
::Notes:These might be as simple as misplacing a hyphen or putting in extra spaces, but most are some form of 
mangling numbers in the CASNumber.  There are over 1,400 versions of these corrected values. To see what 
changes, compare the FracFocus field 'CASNumber' with the OpenFF field 'bgCAS'. There are some instances where a raw CASNumber is
a valid CASRN, but it is clearly erroneous (e.g., there are a few CASNumbers for DNA).  On closer examination, these 
CASNumbers are very close typographically to another commonly used FracFocus chemical.

# Disclosure records only one chemical
::START:
::Title:Disclosure records only one chemical
::Flag_id:d_006
::Date_entered: 2024/3/11
::Description: Disclosure records only one chemical (typically either water or sand). For many of these disclosures,
the single chemical is not recorded as 100% of the fracking fluid.
::Notes:This issue probably extends to disclosures with just two or three chemical records.

# Chlorine dioxide at levels > 80%
::START:
::Title: Chlorine dioxide at levels > 80%
::Flag_id:d_007
::Date_entered: 2024/3/30
::Description: Disclosure reports a percentage of chlorine dioxide of greater than 80%.  This is likely due to the reporter calling the water carrier that is laced with chlorine dioxide as only chlorine dioxide.  There are several instances where this value is 100%.  Because this is an unacceptable carrier material, these disclosures will have unusable calculated mass.

# Sand occupies more than 50% of the fluid total 
::START:
::Title: Sand more than 50% of fluid total
::Flag_id: d_008
::Date_entered: 2024/3/30
::Description: Disclosure with a PercentHFJob of greater than 50%.  Our understanding is that this is not functionally possible. In addition, many of the disclosures flagged by this issue report no water (or very little), suggesting that they have mistakenly left the water out of the overall balance of the disclosure sheet.  
::Notes: It is worth noting that where we have checked the MassIngredient seems to be within a reasonable range.  It is likely that for many of these disclosures it is just the PercentHFJob numbers that are off.  Calculated masses should not be available anyway because they are only used when percentages are within normal bounds.

# Colorado publication delays
::START:
::Title:Colorado: disclosures published after deadline
::Flag_id:d_009
::Date_entered: 2024/3/30
::Description: Colorado states: "Within 60 days following the conclusion of a Hydraulic Fracturing
Treatment and in no case later than 120 days after the commencement of such Hydraulic
Fracturing Treatment, the Operator of the Well will complete the Chemical Disclosure
Registry form and post the form on the Chemical Disclosure Registry..."  Because Open-FF has archived downloads spaced mostly about one week apart, we set the trigger for this flag at a conservative 90 days.  Furthermore, Open-FF only began archiving downloads in 2018; we can't estimate publication delay for earlier disclosures.

Furthermore, Open-FF only began archiving downloads in 2018; we can't estimate publication delay for earlier disclosures. It should be noted that Ohio allows disclosure directly to the state, bypassing FracFocus.

::Description: In Texas, operators are required to publish to FracFocus, it appears within 30 days.  (This could be clarified better if someone could dig into the state code.)  Because Open-FF has archived downloads spaced mostly about one week apart, we set the trigger for this flag at a conservative 45 days, even though publication deadline is 30 days.  Furthermore, Open-FF only began archiving downloads in 2018; we can't estimate publication delay for earlier disclosures.

::Flag_id:d_012
::Date_entered: 2024/3/30
::Description: In Pennsylvania, operators of unconventional gas wells are required to publish to FracFocus, it appears within 60 days.  Because Open-FF has archived downloads spaced mostly about one week apart, we set the trigger for this flag at a conservative 80 days, even though publication deadline is 60 days.  Furthermore, Open-FF only began archiving downloads in 2018; we can't estimate publication delay for earlier disclosures. 

::Notes:From https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Energy/OilandGasPrograms/Act13/Pages/Act-13-FAQ.aspx :
"Because the registry must be used for all hydraulic fracturing of unconventional wells performed on or after April 16, 2012, the Department expects all operators to be registered with FracFocus.org and be prepared to begin using the registry. Within 60 days of the conclusion of hydraulic fracturing, operators must complete and post the chemical registry disclosure form on the registry."
